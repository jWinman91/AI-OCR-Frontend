# AI-Optical-Character-Recognition (AI-OCR) Frontend: Extracting data from images


This repository is the frontend code for a tool with which you can extract data from images using visual LLMs.
The backend code (using fastapi) can be found here: [AI-OCR](https://github.com/jWinman91/AI-OCR).

## Installation

To use the AI-OCR tool, it is best if you install both repositories, backend and frontend, i.e. follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository for the backend
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jWinman91/AI-OCR.git
cd ai-ocr
```
2. Install the required dependencies for the backend:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Pull and run the coachdb docker file with the following command:
```bash
docker run -e COUCHDB_USER=admin -e COUCHDB_PASSWORD=JensIsCool -p 5984:5984 -d --name config_db couchdb:latest
```
3. Clone the frontend repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jWinman91/AI-OCR-Frontend.git
cd ai-ocr-frondend
```
3. Install the required dependencies for the frontend:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You can then start the backend by running:
```bash
python app.py $IP_ADDRESS
```
Make sure that the docker container for the coachdb is running.

Since, the backend uses fastapi, you could now try it out via the fastapi docs by going to ```$IP_ADDRESS:5000/docs```.

But you can also start the frontend now by running:
``` bash
chmod +x start_up.sh
./start_up.sh
```
from within the cloned frontend repository.

A streamlit window will automaticall open in your browser.
Within the web application you'll then find two pages on the sidebar:
* AI-OCR: Webpage for running the actual optical character recognition
* Model Configurations: Subpage for configuring the models (e.g. ChatGPT, Llava, ...)
